Demo Matlab scripts for denoise of 2P Ca2+ linescan and resonance scan video
 

## How to run ##
* In Matlab, move current working directory to the folder ./basic_denoise
* To denoise and extract Ca dynamic from linescan files:<br />
Run the file linescan_demo.m <br />
Select the linescan file and the corresponding metadata file in the /demo_data folder<br />
Draw ROI for the dendritic branch and the spine<br />
* To denoise and extract Ca dynamic from resonance imaging videos:<br />
Run the file resonance_demo.m <br />
Select the video in the /demo_data folder<br />
Draw ROI for the cell/branch of interest <br />
